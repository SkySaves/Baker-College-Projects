# Marathons: Race Time Analysis and Calculator
Welcome to the Marathons repository! This C# console application is designed to assist runners and enthusiasts in analyzing race times and calculating paces. It offers two distinct functionalities: calculating pace for a single race and analyzing multiple race times.
## Features
* Pace Calculator (Program 1): Calculates the pace per mile and per kilometer for a given race time and distance. Users can input the race time in HH:MM:SS format and the distance in either kilometers or miles.
* Race Time Analyzer (Program 2): Allows users to input up to 10 race times in HH:MM:SS format. The program then calculates and displays the fastest, slowest, and average race times.
## How It Works
Upon running the application, users are prompted to choose between the Pace Calculator and the Race Time Analyzer. Depending on the choice, the application either calculates the pace for a single race or analyzes multiple race times.
