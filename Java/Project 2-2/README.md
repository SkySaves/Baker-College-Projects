# Java Project 2-2: Age Calculator GUI Application

## Description

The Age Calculator GUI Application is a simple yet effective Java Swing application that allows users to input their birthdate and calculates their age based on the given date. The application demonstrates handling user inputs, performing calculations with dates, and updating the GUI to display results.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Java Swing, offering a clear and intuitive graphical user interface.
- **Date Input**: Users can enter their birthdate in the format `MM/dd/yyyy`.
- **Age Calculation**: Upon entering a valid date and clicking the "Calculate Age" button, the application calculates and displays the user's age.
- **Error Handling**: The application provides feedback for incorrect date formats, guiding the user to correct errors.

## How to Run

Ensure that Java and the Java Development Kit (JDK) are installed on your system. Follow these steps to compile and run the application:

1. Compile the Java file:

    ```bash
    javac BirthdateGUIApp.java
    ```

2. Execute the compiled class:

    ```bash
    java BirthdateGUIApp
    ```

## Using the Application

- Start the application to open the "Age Calculator" window.
- Enter your birthdate in the specified format (`MM/dd/yyyy`) in the text field.
- Click on "Calculate Age" to see your age displayed on the screen. If the date format is incorrect, a message will prompt you to correct it.

## Conclusion

The Age Calculator GUI Application serves as a practical introduction to developing interactive applications with Java Swing. It encompasses core programming concepts such as parsing string inputs, working with dates, and basic error handling within a graphical user interface context.
