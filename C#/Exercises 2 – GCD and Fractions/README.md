# CombinedProgram: Greatest Common Divisor and Fractions Calculator
Welcome to the CombinedProgram repository! This C# console application offers two functionalities: calculating the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers and performing basic operations with fractions. It's a simple yet effective demonstration of basic mathematical concepts implemented in C#.
## Features
* Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculation: Using Euclid's algorithm, this program can calculate the GCD of two integers.
* Fraction Operations: The application can create fractions, add and multiply them, and convert them to decimal format. It also simplifies fractions to their lowest terms.
* User Choice: At the start, users can choose which functionality to use - GCD calculation or fraction operations.
## How It Works
Upon running the application, users are prompted to choose between two options: calculating the GCD of two predefined sets of numbers or performing operations with fractions. Depending on the choice, the application either calculates the GCD using Euclid's algorithm or creates fractions and performs addition and multiplication operations on them.
