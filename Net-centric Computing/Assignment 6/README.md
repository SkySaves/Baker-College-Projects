# Historical CPI Data in the US - Web Presentation

## Overview

This project presents a comprehensive view of the Historical Consumer Price Index (CPI) in the United States from 1913 to the present, displayed in a cleanly formatted HTML table. The purpose of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to dynamically generate an HTML document presenting structured data, in this case, CPI information, utilizing Python for data manipulation and HTML/CSS for presentation.

## Project Components

- **HTML Document (`index.html`)**: Displays the CPI data in a tabular format, with styling applied for readability and visual appeal. This document includes a navigation link to validate the HTML structure and a link to the data source.
- **Python Script**: Reads raw CPI data from a text file and generates an HTML table. This script showcases the practical application of Python for web content generation.

## Key Features

- **Data Visualization**: Tabular presentation of the CPI data, enhancing the accessibility of complex data sets.
- **Responsive Design**: Utilizes basic CSS for styling, ensuring that the content is legible and visually appealing across different devices.
- **Dynamic Content Generation**: Demonstrates the use of Python for generating HTML content, providing a template for similar tasks involving dynamic web content creation.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Place your CPI data in a text file named `cpi_data.txt`.
3. Run the provided Python script to generate the HTML file:
    ```bash
    python script_name.py
    ```
4. Open the generated HTML file in a web browser to view the formatted CPI data.

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Python

## Source of CPI Data

CPI data was sourced from [Rate Inflation](https://www.rateinflation.com/consumer-price-index/usa-historical-cpi/), which provides detailed historical CPI information for the United States.

## Validation

This HTML document has been validated for XHTML 1.0 compliance, ensuring adherence to web standards for compatibility and accessibility.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies the integration of Python scripting with HTML/CSS to automate the process of data presentation on the web. It highlights how simple scripts can significantly enhance the efficiency of web content generation and presentation, especially for data-intensive displays.
